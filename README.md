# E-commerce storefront for Hollow Knight

- First attempt to making an e-commerce storefront (definitely not easy)
    - tribute to one of my favourite Metroidvania games
- Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Showcase [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) theming
    - [how I customized](src/bootstrap.scss), probably the most interesting file to check out
- Next steps
    - more products
    - checkout section
- If you're interested in making your own Hollow Knight website [curated images for your own projects](src/img)
